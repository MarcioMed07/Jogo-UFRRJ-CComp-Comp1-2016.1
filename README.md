#	SUPER SMASH E.T.

This project is a linux only game inspired by [Smash TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_TV) made for a college project.
It'd been made with C and SDL2

## Prerequisites
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) v^7.4.0
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) v^2.0.0

If you're using linux you probably already have the correct version of gcc installed, if you're having problems installing SDL [lazyfoo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php) has a great tutorial describing the installation proccess.

## Usage
You will only need to clone this repository, navigate to the games folder and execute a shell script to create the executable

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcioMed07/Jogo-UFRRJ-CComp-Comp1-2016.1.git
cd Jogo-UFRRJ-CComp-Comp1-2016.1
sh mk.sh
```

When the executable has been created you only need to execute it with
```bash
Super_Smash
```
